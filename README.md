# NecroBotWiki
Reference document for the original NecroBot intended for Educational use only.

Welcome to the Unofficial NecroBot wiki!

This wiki was rebuilt by DNA64 using google cached pages from multiple sources in a effort to preserve the information for educational purposes. Some contents may be missing or removed as they are no longer relevant or available, while other outdated and irrelevant information may still remain. I have also made several improvements including corrections, as well as added additional information. This is my first time creating a wiki on GitHub, so please keep this in mind while using this wiki.
