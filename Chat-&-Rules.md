Please keep your conversations in the designated channels.

## Talking about other bots

Talking/chatting about other bots can be done on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/pogobots/), the Discord channel is meant for Necrobot.

### Rules

1.  Do not argue with ranks, this means anyone who has a rank higher than Donator.
2.  Do not post pre-compiled programs/links except for NecroBot's official Github releases.
3.  Posting binaries is forbidden (who knows what might be in there).
4.  Selling in our Discord server is not allowed.
5.  Keep it mature, don't insult people, be respectful, and have fun.
6.  Github link's to forks of FeroxRev's PokemonGo.RocketAPI belong in the `#forks` channels
  * Posting links to all other bots are not allowed. This includes web services, scripts, and forum posts.
  * Extended discussion of other bots can be reserved for the #off-topic or private messages
7.  Posting in the `#90_plus_iv` channel without following the syntax/format will result in an instant ban no questions asked
  * This includes typing irrelevant information in the extra info field
  * Format/syntax can be found in the `#90_plus_iv` chat description
8. Chat in English only.

Keep in mind that new rules can be added at any time. Moderators, helpers and other ranks have the right to mute, ban and kick if needed.

## Some more info

Just to clarify few things... The discord server is for the Necronomicon main repo, support for other forks will be at the very least limited (if not totally unsupported) to the `#forks` channels.

This does not mean we forbid any forks, this is all open-source so by all means. We just wish you contribute to the community.
